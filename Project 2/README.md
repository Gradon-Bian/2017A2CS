Introduction:
## Gradon Bian S3C5 Opt 1
## Spring Holiday Project: **The Maze Runner** (Using the newly learnt python knowledge: Recursion)
## The maze: a 2D array that consists of numerous 0s (which indicate the wall), and 1s (which is the pathway).
## This program can identify whether it is possible to reach the top-left corner (the Exit) of the maze (array) when starting from the coordinate (x,y).
## The coordination of an element can be identified and hence calculated using the array.


## An example of a 6*6 array (which I used in the program):
maze=[[1,0,0,1,0,1],
      [1,1,1,1,1,0],
      [0,0,1,0,1,0],
      [0,1,1,1,0,0],
      [1,0,0,1,0,0],
      [1,0,0,0,0,1]]
