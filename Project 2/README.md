Introduction:
## Gradon Bian S3C5 Opt 1
## Spring Holiday Project: **The Maze Runner** (Using the newly learnt python knowledge: Recursion)
## The maze: a 2D array that consists of numerous 0s (which indicate the wall), and 1s (which is the pathway).
## This program can identify whether it is possible to reach the top-left corner (the Exit) of the maze (array) when starting from the coordinate (x,y).
## The coordination of an element can be identified and hence calculated using the array.


## An example of a 6*6 array (which I used in the program):
maze=[[1,0,0,1,0,1],
      [1,1,1,1,1,0],
      [0,0,1,0,1,0],
      [0,1,1,1,0,0],
      [1,0,0,1,0,0],
      [1,0,0,0,0,1]]

# Update: The Maze Runner V.2#

## This new version can trace through a larger maze. For the maze (array),   "1" means path, and "0" means wall. After running through the maze successfully, the program will output its path by changing the "1s" it passed into "2s".## 



## The entrance is from top-left corner, the exit is at the bottom-right corner.##
