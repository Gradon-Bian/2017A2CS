### Question 1: a i

```python
class CustomerRecord :

	def __init__(self) :

		self.CustomerID = 0

		self.CustomerName = ''

		self.TelNumber = ''

		self.TotalOrders = 0

```

### Question 1: a ii

```python
CustomerData = [CustomerRecord() for i in range(1000)]
```



### Quesion 1: b i

```python
def Hash(ID) :
	Address = ID % 1000
	return (Address)
```



### Question 1: b ii (I did this wrong)

```python
def AddRecord(CustomerData, Customer):
	Address = Hash(Customer.CustomerID)
	while CustomerData(Address).CustomerID != 0 :
		Address = Address + 1
		if Address = 1000 :
			Address = 0
	CustomerData[Address] = Customer
```



### Question 1: b iii

```python
def FindRecord(CustomerData, ID):
	Address = Hash(ID)
	while CustomerData[Address].CustomerID != ID :
		Address = Address + 1
        if Address = 1000 :
			Address = 0
	return (Address)
```



### Question 1: c

```python
import pickle
def SaveData(CustomerData) :
	CustomerFile = open('CustomerData.Dat','wb')
	for i in range(1000) :
		pickle.dump(CustomerData[i], CustomerFile)
	CustomerFile.close()
```



### Question 1: d (I did this wrong)

Need to set up fixed length dummy records and save them to a random file.
AddRecord needs to update the correct record in the random file.
FindRecord needs to read the random file. Donâ€™t need the SaveData procedure at the end of program execution



### Question 2

```python
def OpenFile() :
	FileName = input("Which file do you want to use? ")
	try:
		FileHandle = open(FileName, 'rb+')
	except :
		print("File does not exist")
```
