My codes for Computer Science classwork and homework
Here I will upload my codes (mainly in Python) from the A-Level Computer Science couse class of RDFZ, ICC.

Introduction:
## Gradon Bian S3C5 Opt 1
## Christmas Holiday Project: Word Count Tool (Using the newly learnt python knowledge: Dictionary)
## This program can identify the words that appear more than twice in a given text, and list them out with the number of times they appear
## This program can also list the words in both Dictionary order, and Alphabetical order (for the ease of reading).
## This program should also be able to delete all the useless punctuation in the text.

** You can use this text as a test example : (Yes... this comes from TOEFL)

In the search for novel sounds, increased use has been made in Western music of Microtones. Non-Western music typically divides and interval between two pitches more finely than Western music does, thereby producing a greter number of distinct tones, or micro tones, within the same interval. Composers such as Krzysztof Pmderecki create sound that borders on electronic noise through tone clusters¡ªclosely spaced tones played together and heard as a mass, block, or band of sound. The directional aspect of sound has taken on new importance as well Loudspeakers or groups of instruments may be placed at opposite ends of the stage, in the balcony, or at the back and sides of the auditorium. Because standard music notation makes no provision for many of these innovations, recent music scores may contain graphlike diagrams, new note shapes and symbols, and novel ways of arranging notation on the page. 


** You can also try this program out by inputing whatever text you want, but remeber: if the whole text has no words that repeat above two times, there will be no input!

# My Christmas Project
Here I will upload my design and code for my Christmas holiday project (in Python).
Right now, I'm planning to create an algorithm that can convert an ordinary picture into a character drawing (ASCII art).
