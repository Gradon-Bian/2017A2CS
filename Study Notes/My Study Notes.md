# Chapter 7: System Software 
###Book page:78-87

##1.Key words definition:
**Operating system**: a software platform that provides facilities for programs to be run which are of benefit to a user.
**Process**: a program that has begun execution
##2.Chapter Summary:
* Operating system tasks can be categorised in more than one way, for example, some are for helping the user, others are for running the system.
* Utility  programs for a PC include hard disk utilities, backup programs, virus checkers and file compression utilities.
* Library programs, including Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files, are available to be incorporated into programs; they are usually subroutines and are very reliable.
* For a two -pass assembler,typical activities in the first pass are creation of a symbol table and expansion of macros; object code is generated in the second pass.
* A high-level language can be translated using an interpreter or a compiler.
* A Java compiler produces Java Byte Code which is interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine.
##3.Operating Activities:
* User-system interface: allow the user to get the software and hardware to do useful things. At least provide a **command-line interace** and a **graphical user interface(GUI)**.
* Program-hardware interface: ensure that the hardware does what the software wants it to do. Provide the mechanism for the execution of the developed program.
* Resource management: when the execution of a program has begun it is described as a **process**, each process needs access to the resources provided by the computer system (scheduling of processes,resolution of conflicts when two processes require the same resource).
* Memory management: memory protection, achieve optimum usage of a limited memory size, decisions about which processes should be in main memory at any one time.
* Device management: installation of the appropriate device driver software, control of usage by processes.
* File management:file naming conventions, directory(folder)structures, access control mechanisms.
* Security managment: provision for recovery when data is lost, prevention of intrusion, ensuring data privacy.
* Error detection and recovery: interrupt a running process and provide error diagnostics where appropriate.
##4.Utility programs used by a PC
* Hard disk formatter and checker
* Hard disk defragmenter
* Backup software
* File compressions
*Virus checker
##5.Language translators:
*Assemblers
*Compilers & interpreters [**Go to page 85 to see their difference**]
*Java
